# Global review of non-native aquatic Ponto-Caspian species

## Overview

This repository accompanies the paper **Global review of non-native aquatic Ponto-Caspian species** and provides the full dataset and scripts used to produce the analyses, figures, and maps.

It includes:
- A curated list of 142 non-native aquatic Ponto-Caspian (NNAPC) species
- Verified taxonomy cross-checked with GBIF
- Pathway classifications (CBD primary and secondary levels) --> See Saul et al. 2016
- Occurrence and first record data --> From GBIF
- Hydrobasin shapefiles for spatial mapping --> From Hydrobasin
- First records --> From Saffer et al. 2024

## How to Use

1. **Browse data**: Open the `.xlsx` files to see the species list, pathways, and first record information.
2. **Reproduce plots**: Run the `Pathways.r` script in R to generate pathway visuals.
3. **Map distributions**: Use the HydroRIVERS shapefiles (`.shp`) in GIS software to map basin-level richness.
4. **Check taxonomy**: Cross-reference with the GBIF backbone provided.
